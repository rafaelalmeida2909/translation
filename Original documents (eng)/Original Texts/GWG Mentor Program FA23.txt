The 1:1 Mentor Program - We need you!

Help strengthen the pipeline of females pursuing STEM-related fields

The 1:1 Mentor program 
By acting as a role model, mentors provide inspiration, encouragement, and leadership to the girls as they  learn more about possibilities in STEM.   
The mentorship relationship between the Junior  and Senior Mentor take place over the duration of  the cohort (first week of January) and is comprised  of five posts back and forth between Senior and  Junior mentors using the Flip (previously Flipgrid)  environment. Some corporations (like Dell) may  block the Flip site while you are using your corporate  credentials, so please use your personal credentials  (Gmail, for example) to log in to Flip.

Please note that this is not a technical mentorship opportunity.
