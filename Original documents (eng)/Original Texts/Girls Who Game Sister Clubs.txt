Girls Who Game Sister Clubs

Sister Clubs are an optional component of Girls Who Game–a fun and engaging opportunity to extend  community among clubs, and provide friendship and mentorship to students and coaches. The Sister Clubs component pairs clubs located in different regions around the world to meet and engage in diverse activities.   
Through participation in Sister Clubs, students will be exposed to new geographic and cultural areas,  foster unique friendships that transcend distance and borders, and further develop soft skills, such as public speaking, teamwork, problem solving, and more.

What are the goals of Sister Clubs?
• Extend community among clubs in a non competitive, social way and increase communication and cohesiveness across all clubs.  
• Provide geographic and cultural awareness to students, including experiential insight into what it’s like to live in a different community (cultural, climate, urban/rural, etc.).  
• Introduce some additional fun to the program.

Why participate in Sister Clubs?  
• Coaches/teaching champions have the ability  to connect and learn from other regions’ clubs, sharing ideas and gaining new perspectives  within the Girls Who Game ecosystem.  
• Students can create new friendships while developing and learning from culturally and geographically diverse perspectives.  
• Introduce some additional fun time to the program. 

How it works  
• Girls Who Game will connect you with a club in a different region/country.  
• Each club is challenged with a puzzle related to their Sister Club and one which the other club knows the answer.  
• Clubs meet to share their ideas and guess answers.  
• Collaborative/ice breaker materials will be provided to assist you.  
• The program is completed with each team  composing a short 1-minute video about what they learned about the other group.  
• The Sister Clubs are introduced within Flip. After the initial introduction, the Sister Clubs manage  the ongoing relationship (frequency, etc.).
