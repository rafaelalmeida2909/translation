Why join Girls Who Game?

Demand for computing skills are on the rise

Computing skills are highly coveted in the job market, with demand growing to 3 times the North American average. Many girls, especially minority girls, are being left behind. Less than a quarter of computing jobs are held by women, and that number is declining. Girls Who Game clubs seek to bridge this gap by providing an extracurricular support to young females and educators across North America.

These clubs provide an opportunity build community through gaming, strengthen STEM skills using Minecraft as a learning tool, and provide insight on career  opportunities to student through mentorship.  
Research shows that 74% of middle school girls who participate in STEM clubs and activities say they are likely to study computer science in high school.
